# Food-Delivery-Cost-And-Delivery-Analysis

<h2>Overview</h2>

This project focuses on analyzing data from the food delivery industry, specifically using the food_orders_new_delhi dataset. The dataset contains information about food orders, delivery details, costs, and profits. Through this analysis, we aim to gain insights into the profitability of food delivery services in New Delhi, India.

<h2>Analysis Goals</h2>

Profit Analysis: Explore the distribution of profits and identify factors influencing profitability.
Delivery Fee Analysis: Analyze the impact of delivery fees on overall profits.
Time Analysis: Examine trends in order placement and delivery times to optimize operational efficiency.
Simulated Profit Analysis: Use predictive modeling techniques to simulate profits and evaluate potential scenarios.

<h2>Methodology</h2>

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory analysis to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
Visualization: Create visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, and time series plots, to illustrate findings and trends.
Profit Simulation: Develop predictive models to simulate profits under different scenarios, such as varying delivery fees or order volumes.
Results and Findings

<h2>Profit Analysis Results:</h2>

Profits vary across different restaurants and customer segments.
Delivery fees have a significant impact on overall profitability, with higher fees potentially reducing customer demand.

<h2>Time Analysis Insights:</h2>

Peak hours for order placement and delivery coincide with meal times, indicating the importance of efficient service during these periods.
Delays in delivery times can lead to customer dissatisfaction and reduced profits.

<h2>Simulated Profit Analysis:</h2>

Simulations suggest that optimizing delivery routes and reducing delivery times can increase profits.
Adjusting delivery fees based on distance or order value can help balance profitability and customer satisfaction.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

By analyzing the food_orders_new_delhi dataset, this project provides valuable insights into the profitability and operational efficiency of food delivery services in New Delhi.
